# Echelon Test

I had a great time with this challenge. I have been doing purely backend work for over a year at this point so it was fun getting to work in the front end again. I went beyond the stated requirements (and time limit) in the instructions mainly as an excuse to learn about React with Typescript and testing React applications. I've taught React before but I've never used it professionally nor had occasion to use it with Typescript.

Hopefully you're impressed with the results!

## Description

A front-end app that renders test JSON data. The rendered data contains fake exercise video details.

## Usage

The app can be run locally with `npm i` and `npm start` from root directory.
Automated tests can be run with `npm test`.
The live site is deployed at [https://leewarrick.com/echelon-test](https://leewarrick.com/echelon-test).

- Preview course through modal with class info

## Note about authors

I accidentally had my `.gitconfig` set to fake University of Florida credentials for some git videos I created for a course. Commits from "Instructor" came from me.
